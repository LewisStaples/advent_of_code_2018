Notes on day18 part 2:

I presume that the coders are not expected to have the program evaluate each acre 1000000000 times.  (It would take too long to do that!)

Probably the approach is to run it several times until a loop is discovered, so it will be sufficient to traverse the loop once only, and then extrapolate for times beyond that.

I will use a deque, just in case it requires running many times before the loop starts.
